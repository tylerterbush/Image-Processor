# Image-Processor
Many image processing functions were implemented to mimic the many features that Photoshop has to offer. 
These methods are implemented within the image.todo.cpp in the Image directory. The input looks as follows:
% Assignment1 --brighten 1.1 --in in.bmp --out out.bmp
The function that we wish to call on the image is specified and any inputs to that function are given. The image that we wish to change is given and the image file we wish to output to is given.
